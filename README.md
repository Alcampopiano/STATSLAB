## STATSLAB: An open-source EEG toolbox for computing single-subject effects using robust statistics

Features:

* GUI with built-in documentation (no programming knowledge required)
* Percentile bootstrap test using trimmed means 
* Analyze scalp and independent components data (ICA)
* Measure microvolts, global-field power, and time-frequency measures (ERSP, ITC)
* Single-subject and group-level hypothesis tests
* Interactive figures allow you to visualize difference waves, topographies, CIs, and p values
* Correlate ERPs with external measures and create scatterplots and LOWESS curves
* All statistics are stored in an easy-to-navigate structure

Resources: 

* STATSLAB citation coming soon...

* The newest documentation is built into the STATSLAB GUI. Simply download STATSLAB, put it on your MATLAB path (along with EEGLAB), and type statslab into the command line to see the GUI and documentation.
